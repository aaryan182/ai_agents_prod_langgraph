multi agent orchestration , LLM as router , Conditional branching, Human in the loop approval, State persistence across turns, Escalation logic


Agents involved:

Ticket Classifier Agent
-> Classifies ticket into: technical, billing, general
-> Outputs confidence score

Resolution Agents (3): 

Technical Support Agent
Billing Support Agent
General Support Agent

Human in the loop Node
-> Pauses workflow for human review on low confidence or complex cases

Escalation Logic
-> If confidence < threshold OR unresolved → escalate

Persistent Ticket Memory
-> Ticket history across multiple messages (Redis / DB abstraction)
